# Code Refactor Challenge
# Description 
Using the CSS "box model" this is a landing site made up from five div elements within its body: Header, Hero, Content, Benefits, and Footer. Included in the Header is a Nav made up from a <"UL"> element and three <"Li"> elements. Each <"Li"> element is assigned an <"a href"> tag specific to one of the three corresponding child <"div"> elements nested within the parent Content <"div">. These three <"div"> elements contain an <"IMG"> <"H2"> and a <"P"> element. The CSS file contains style alterations organized into groups based off the section the alterations apply too. These groups have been labeled with comments as well as commented descriptions of what changes were made to consolidate the code.
